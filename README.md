# Design Choices

## Fonts

For "Chelsea Pride," I have chosen distinct and complementary fonts from Google Fonts to enhance the website's readability and aesthetic appeal.

- **Main Text: Lato** - [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") is a sans-serif font known for its clarity and modern feel. It provides a clean, approachable look, making it perfect for the main content, where legibility is key.

- **Headers and Navigation Bar: Raleway** - To create a clear distinction between the main text and headers, I've selected [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"). This font, with its elegant and slightly more stylized characters, complements Lato while ensuring that headers and navigation elements are noticeable and appealing.

## Icons

The website will incorporate icons from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") Font Awesome library. These icons will be used intuitively, ensuring they are self-explanatory. Key areas for their use include social media links, contact links, and a hamburger menu icon for navigation on mobile devices. All icons will be styled to align with the overall design of the website.

## Colors

For the color scheme, I've used [Colors.co](https://colors.co/ "Colors") to generate a palette that resonates with Chelsea FC's identity while ensuring good contrast and visual appeal.

![Colour Pallet](wireframes/color-palette.png)

- #034694 - This colour will be used in headers and key interface elements.

- ##C0C0C0 - This color will be used for secondary elements like borders, buttons, and icon backgrounds to provide a modern, sophisticated look.

- ##F5F5F5 - This color will be used for the website's background, ensuring that the content stands out without causing strain to the eyes.

- ##383838 - This color will be use for the main text, providing excellent readability against the off-white background while softening the contrast compared to pure black.

- ##D4AF37 - This color will be used for highlighting important elements such as active menu items or call-to-action buttons, adding a touch of elegance and importance.

# Structure

The website will be developed with a 'mobile-first' approach, prioritizing optimization for smaller screens before scaling up to larger devices. This approach aligns with modern web design practices, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.

## Mobile-First Design

- **Base Size**: The development will start with styling for the iPhone 5/SE, which represents one of the smallest screen sizes (320px) commonly in use. This ensures that the design remains functional and visually appealing on smaller screens.

## Responsive Breakpoints

Responsive breakpoints will be defined based on the updated [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) Bootstrap breakpoints, which are widely recognized and align with contemporary device standards. These breakpoints allow the layout to adapt dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal readability and usability.

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
|-------------|------------|
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | ≥576px     |
| medium      | ≥768px     |
| large       | ≥992px     |
| x-large     | ≥1200px    |
| xx-large    | ≥1400px    |
